# rally-modern-sdk
An exploration of what a more modern SDK for Broadcom's Rally ALM could look like.

Rally's public SDK uses ExtJS 4, which is a crime against developers. Internally they're using a new React-based kit, which may never see the light of day for us.

This is an attempt to make something in Svelte that looks comparable to their React kit.
